# Machine-Learning-Exam-Project

Using this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability) i tried to predict if a water sample is potable or not.
The first part of the scrips is the EDA phase where i filled missing values and plotted every features to find any visibile pattern.
Then i splitted the data into test set and train set to train varius classification algorithms like: KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM and Neural Network.

What emerges from the EDA phase and the execution of the algorithms is that the data are probably not real, thus the performance of every algorithm is low.
