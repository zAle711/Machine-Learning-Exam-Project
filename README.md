# Machine-Learning-Exam-Project

This project was developed for the Machine Learning exam.

I utilized a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityakadiwal/water-potability) containing water samples where the label indicates potability. The initial phase involves Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) where I inspect the data, handle possible null values, and check the dataset's balance. The data is normalized and then split into a training set and a test set.

Subsequently, I compare the performance of the following algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Network.
